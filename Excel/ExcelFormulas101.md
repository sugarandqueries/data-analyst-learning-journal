## Excel Formulas 101
Notes I take while I progress through Maven Analytics' Microsoft Excel: Formulas & Functions Course

### Formula Syntax
=MATCH(lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type])
1. Function name (MATCH) is what type of operation you're about to perform
2. Arguments (lookup_value, lookup_array, [match_type]) provide Excel the info needed to perform the operation
   - Not all arguments are required, optional ones are *[surrounded by brackets]*
