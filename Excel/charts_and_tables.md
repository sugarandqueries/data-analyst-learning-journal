**Refresher:**
* x-axis = *cause/independent* values
* y-axis = *effect/ dependent* values

**Histogram chart**

Basic guidelines:

* continuous numerical data
* see how often different ranges of values appear in your data
* a large dataset you want to summarize quickly
* each bin (x-axis) will have a different frequency (y-axis)

**Line Charts**

When to use a line chart:
* you have a large dataset with continuous data that you need to compare
* see changes over time
* find a trend or pattern in our data

**Scatter Charts**

Show the relationship between independent and dependent values of numerical data. They can have more than one y-value for each x-value. 
* If a parttern forms a line, there is a linear correlation (correlation does not equal causation!) The closer the markers are to a straight line, the stronger the correlation.

When to use a scatter chart
* see if there is a relationship btwn 2 columns of numerical data
* have lots of data to compare
* looking for abnormal values that don't follow an overall pattern
* explore data + find relationships

* That little dot between 0.6 and 0.8 on the x-axis is called an outlier!
