**Refresher:**
* x-axis = *cause/independent* values
* y-axis = *effect/ dependent* values

---

**Histogram chart**

Basic guidelines:

* continuous numerical data
* see how often different ranges of values appear in your data
* a large dataset you want to summarize quickly
* each bin (x-axis) will have a different frequency (y-axis)

**Line Charts**

When to use a line chart:
* you have a large dataset with continuous data that you need to compare
* see changes over time
* find a trend or pattern in our data

**Scatter Charts**

Show the relationship between independent and dependent values of numerical data. They can have more than one y-value for each x-value. 
* If a parttern forms a line, there is a linear correlation (correlation does not equal causation!) The closer the markers are to a straight line, the stronger the correlation.

When to use a scatter chart
* see if there is a relationship btwn 2 columns of numerical data
* have lots of data to compare
* looking for abnormal values that don't follow an overall pattern
* explore data + find relationships

* That little dot between 0.6 and 0.8 on the x-axis is called an outlier!

**Trendlines**
also called line of best fit
* how to measure it? use **R-squared,** which explains that the amount of variability in one column can be explained by its relationship to another related column.
    * also measures the strength of the relationship between x and y axis, with 1 being a perfect fit.
* In the first chart below, the R^2 value explains that about 98% of the changes in Actual Temp. can be explained by Apparent Temp.

* For the 2nd chart above, under 40% of the changes in Amount of Bikes Rented can be explained by the changes in Actual Temp. This means that they are loosely correlated, but not as much as the first chart.
