# Data Visualization allows you to *bring your data to life!*


## Choosing the Right Chart Type 
1. Know the **type of data** you're working with (categorical, time series, or numerical)
2. Know what you want to **communicate** (comparison, distribution, composition, or relationship)



### 🌟 General Data Visualization Principles 🌟
* **Exploratory** data visualization: we create charts for ourselves to understand and explore data. 🗺️
  * use a variety of descriptive and visual techniques to see waht types of relationships/insights we could find in the data! 
* **Explanatory** data visualization: we create charts for others to inform, make a point, or explain a relationship. 💬
* Familiarity principle: simple charts are often more easier to remember compared to complex and vibrant ones.
* Larger width charts: best for desktop views 🖥️
    * Larger height= mobile-friendly 📱

### 📊 Design Principles 📊

* Charts have 3 elements:
    1. **Data elements**: numbers and catagories that are represented visually 
    2. **Structural elements**: x/y-axis, labels, legend, gridlines
    3. **Decorations**: other colors and shapes
* When you minimize **structural and decoratory elements**, the attention of your audience is solely on the data.
  * This principle is called **maximizing the data-ink ratio** (Tufte 1983).
  * Generally, you want to remove the border, soften/remove gridlines, and remove the vertical line for a bar chart.


### 👇 Drilling Down / Rolling Up 🆙
* the process of adding additional levels of detail is *drilling down*
* *rolling up* means to view the data at a less detailed level
