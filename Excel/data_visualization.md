#### General data viz. tips
* **Exploratory** data visualization: we create charts for ourselves to understand and explore data. 🗺️
* **Explanatory** data visualization: we create charts for others to inform, make a point, or explain a relationship. 💬
* Familiarity principle: simple charts are often more easier to remember compared to complex and vibrant ones.
* Larger width charts: best for desktop views 🖥️
    * Larger height= mobile-friendly 📱

 #### Design Principles 📊

* Charts have 3 elements:
    1. **Data elements**: numbers and catagories that are represented visually 
    2. **Structural elements**: x/y-axis, labels, legend, gridlines
    3. **Decorations**: other colors and shapes
* When you minimize **structural and decoratory elements**, the attention of your audience is solely on the data.
  * This principle is called **maximizing the data-ink ratio** (Tufte 1983).
  * Generally, you want to remove the border, soften/remove gridlines, and remove the vertical line for a bar chart.



#### Drilling Down / Rolling Up
* the process of adding additional levels of detail is *drilling down*
* *rolling up* means to view the data at a less detailed level
